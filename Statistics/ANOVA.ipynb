    " 1. A clinical trial is run to 3 weight loss program. The outcomes of interest is weight loss, defined as the difference in weight measured at  the start of the study(baseline) and weight measured at end of the study(8 week),measured in pounds. Three popular weight loss program are considered. The 1st is a low calories diet, 2nd is a low fat diet and 3rd is a low carbohydrate diet. For comparison purpose, a forth group is considered fourth group is considered as a control group. A total of twenty patients agree to participate in the study and are randomly assigned to one of the four diet groups. Weights are measured at baseline and patients are counseled on the proper implementation of the assigned diet (with the exception of the control group). After 8 weeks, each patient's weight is again measured and the difference in weights is computed.\n",
